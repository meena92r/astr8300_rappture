PROJECT: Yields tool
========

Creates a plot of Mass fraction vs Mass (in solar masses) using Rappture. 
Input provides species and metallicity (z).

Method:
=======

Input species and choose the metallicity value in/from the Rappture tool. 
Gives the plot between Mass fraction and Mass.
Rappture scale enables us to choose a log-scale as well.
